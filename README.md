## Overview

This system allows patients to book appointments with doctors. When appointments are created, updated, or deleted, notifications are generated. The services communicate through RESTful APIs and run in a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube for local deployment.

---

## Architecture

- Microservices: Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Notification  
- Independent PostgreSQL databases per service  
- RESTful communication  
- JWT-based access control  
- Kubernetes for orchestration  
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana  
- Logging: Loki + Promtail
